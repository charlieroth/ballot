# Ballot

Ballot is an experiment in building a distributed, geographically
fault-tolerant, RAM based, embedded database for holding elections.

Ballot is built with Elixir and minimal dependencies.

Ballot is based on previous work done HCA Healthcare, [Project Waterpark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ0CvjAJXz4). Notes on the Waterpark system can be found in [Waterpark.md](/docs/Waterpark.md)

For an in-depth explaination of the Ballot system see [Ballot.md](/docs/Ballot.md)
