# Ballot

Ballot is an experiment in communal computing to strengthen the democratic
act of holding elections.

Ballot is ran by communities that trust one another, ensuring elections are
maintained by multiple owners rather than a single owner.

Ballot embraces consensus, fault-tolerance and other social mechanisms of
software systems such blockchains.

Blockchain software, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, may be the optimal
solution for holding elections. Ballot is an intermediate technological step
to familiarize society with communal computing.

## Technical Description

Ballot is a distributed, geographically fault-tolerant election and soft
real-time software system with the following attributes:

- RAM-based embedded database for storing election data
- Integration engine for third-parties to analyze election data

Ballot aims to minimize external dependencies for ease of understanding
and auditability.

## Technical Stack

Ballot is built with the Elixir programming language, running on the battle
tested Erlang Virtual Machine, providing a rich set of tools for building
fault-tolerant and distributed software systems.
